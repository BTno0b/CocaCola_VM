			"description": "“Fanta”, a brand name that comes from the German word “Fantasie”, meaning “imagination”. Why does this beloved fizzy drink have a name with German routes, you may be wondering? Well, Fanta was first created in Germany! Yes, that’s right. Fanta came about during the Second World War when there was a trading ban between Germany and any of the Allies’ countries. The Coca-Cola Company, therefore, wasn’t able to bring in the syrup that they needed to produce Coca Cola, and a new soda was invented in its place. It was Dr. Schetelig that was able to bring about this new drink, using only the ingredients that they could procure within Germany. The first Fanta drink was made mainly of apple fibre and a by-product that comes from the process of making cheese. The drink was yellow in colour, yet tasted of oranges. Though Dr. Schetelig is responsible for the formula of Fanta, it was a salesman that decided on the name. This man was Joe Knipp. Coca-Cola liked the name enough to keep it, and Fanta went on to be the second drink that Coca-Cola ever made."

Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local pharmacist, produced the syrup for Coca-Cola, and carried a jug of the new product down the street to Jacobs' Pharmacy, where it was sampled, pronounced 'excellent' and placed on sale for five cents a glass as a soda fountain drink. Carbonated water was teamed with the new syrup to produce a drink that was at once 'Delicious and Refreshing', a theme that continues to echo today wherever Coca-Cola is enjoyed.."

From revolutionary methods and commitment to quality to unforgettable successes that have made Costa Coffee the Nation’s Favourite* coffee shop, our story is as unique as our coffee. But first, let’s start with how every good story should. At the very beginning. The Costa Coffee story began back in 1971 when Sergio and Bruno arrived in London with a burning desire to make great tasting coffee a part of everyday life. Setting up a small roastery in Fenchurch Street, they committed to crafting the finest quality coffee. It was here the Costa brothers blind-tested 112 variations of coffee before they tasted one good enough to be our signature blend. They named it ‘Mocha Italia’ and it remains our signature blend to this day."
